May the time goes worse, but the life never ends
May there b darkness, but the smile never ends
While the cries burst out...still the confidence goes strong
Leading ur life to the time of action
Giving an endless relief of satisfaction
To smile at least for those who smile only when u smile
And on ur journey to present, 
May there b tears but the desire never ends ,the hope never ends bcz try nvr ends
