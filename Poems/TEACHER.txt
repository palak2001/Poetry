(Actually it is difficult to define a teacher and I really had to think hard to write on the subject and here I tried to define 'TEACHER' , dedicated to some very precious teachers we have in our life starting from our parents)

Teacher the one with some extra knowledge
Teacher the one who inderstands
Anything and everything
One who make us understand
Anything and everything
One who makes us understand
Anywhere and everywhere
Teacher who helps you
Anytime and everytime
Teacher who brings out best,
And even helps you develop the rest
One who really deserves respect
Because they made you to interact,
To some very important life's act
The stone-hearted teacher who made you cry
So that you never stop try
He, with no heart, fires your overconfidence
And even lift you up if you lack confidence
Teacher, the one who guides you, abides you
The qualities can never end,
Its effortless to have the time spend,
Here the description ends....
