Life goes on, time goes on
I was just born
It was all happiness, here and there,
And distribution of sweets everywhere.
My mother took me in her hand,
I felt like I had angel's band.
Now it's turn for my father to pick me.
Then, a name was ticked for me
Life goes on, time goes on.
The buzzing breeze blows on.
I stand, I fall, I run, I scroll
I dance like a doll
Life goes on, time goes on
Now my seventeenth year comes on,
And I kept writing so, on and on....
