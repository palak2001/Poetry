We are miles apart, but still together
We are far, very far, but still together
Connected with thoughts
Connected as wireless network
&
With a beautiful band
The band of care, the band of love
The band which is over and above
I don't know when I'll see you again
Maybe after few months or may an year drain
But I don't have any tear
Because I know you are always here
My antique piece,
Are we lost in this world?
The world full of beauty and thrill!
The world whose silece kill!
The world with dry tears!
The world where no one hears!
With a mixture of thoughts, I end here,
Togetherness is always meaningful with Separation&Dare
